# Name of Taster Session

## Introduction

This repository contains all notebooks and materials for the "Anomaly detection in time series using Python" webinar.

## Deliver the Session

`webinar_timeser_anomaly.ipynb` contains the slides

`webinar_timeser_anomaly_supplementary.ipynb` contains the full code

Feel free to look at the program, the dataset and speaker's contact in `webinar_timeser_anomaly.ipynb`

You need Jupyter Notebooks to open this file. If you are new to Python, we recommend installing the Anaconda package.

To be able to run all of the code yourself, check "requirements.txt" for the list of needed Python libraries.
